# Plans
- Accessing https://www.jamesdekorne.com/GBCh/hex{number}.htm for hexagram description
- ? Randomized throws
- User reaction based coin throws
  - gif
  - based on user response or position
- Read char sequence from question as coin throw results. Like oo1, hht, ffi, 001, etc

### Use the following URL format:
https://www.perplexity.ai/?s=O&q=your_question_here
Replace "your_question_here" with your actual question. This will open Perplexity.ai and perform a search for your question

### You can also add Perplexity.ai as a custom search engine in your browser with the following URL:
https://www.perplexity.ai/search?q=%s
Then when you type your question in the address bar and hit enter, it will open Perplexity.ai and search for your question

### Some additional tips:
You can add more parameters to the URL like &focus=[internet,scholar,writing,wolfram,youtube,reddit] to specify the search focus
Setting copilot=true will enable pro mode for the search
The OpenAI API can also be used to access models programmatically
