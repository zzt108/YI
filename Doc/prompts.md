## Prompt

your task: make this hardcoded text fully configurable on cvConfig:
Use placeholders for the already existing variables in the text

@/YiChing/cvHexagram.xaml.cs
```csharp
return $"{DateTime.Now:yyyy-MM-dd}\nQuestion to I Ching:\n {rtQuestion.Text}\n"
+ $"\nI Ching answered:\n{rtAnswer.Text}\nWould you please interpret?\n\nPlease translate to {_mainPage.CVConfig.Settings.AnswerLanguage}.";
```

# Result
	- Identified 
		- questionPrefix = "Question to I Ching:";
		- answerPrefix = "I Ching answered:";
		- interpretationRequest = "Would you please interpret?";

	- Forgot about
		- \n\nPlease translate to {_mainPage.CVConfig.Settings.AnswerLanguage}.
		- adding handling controls to cvConfig form
		- how configuration persistence is done

I have a prompt in a sw dev agent, pls help me to refine it

## Prompt

Make the hardcoded text in the given C# code snippet fully configurable by using placeholders for existing variables. Ensure all text elements, including both recognized and overlooked parts, have configurations in `cvConfig`.

# Steps

1. **Identify Configurable Elements**: Extract all hardcoded text and variable elements that need to be made part of the configuration.
   - Recognized Text Elements:
     - `questionPrefix = "Question to I Ching:"`
     - `answerPrefix = "I Ching answered:"`
     - `interpretationRequest = "Would you please interpret?"`
   - still missing Text Elements:
     - Language translation line: `\n\nPlease translate to {_mainPage.CVConfig.Settings.AnswerLanguage}.`

2. **Use Placeholders**: Utilize placeholders in the code for each identified element.
   - Incorporate placeholders for recognized elements.
   - Add placeholders for overlooked elements.

3. **Integration with cvConfig**: 
   - Introduce controls in the cvConfig form to handle and modify these text elements.
   - Ensure configuration changes persist across sessions.

4. **Code Revision**: Update the original C# code snippet by replacing hardcoded texts with placeholders linked to `cvConfig`.

# Output Format

- Provide the updated C# code snippet with placeholders for all text elements linked to `cvConfig`.
- Describe how handling controls should be added to the `cvConfig` form.
- Explain how configuration persistence will be achieved.

# Examples

**Input**
@/YiChing/cvHexagram.xaml.cs
```csharp
return $"{DateTime.Now:yyyy-MM-dd}\nQuestion to I Ching:\n {rtQuestion.Text}\n"
+ $"\nI Ching answered:\n{rtAnswer.Text}\nWould you please interpret?\n\nPlease translate to {_mainPage.CVConfig.Settings.AnswerLanguage}.";
```

# Notes

- Ensure that any changes to configuration via the cvConfig interface are saved and loaded correctly to maintain user settings.
- Consider edge cases where certain configuration elements might be null or missing, and handle these gracefully in the application logic.

## Result

   - Seems okay
## New needs

Replace the current question structure to the below defined new output example:

### Examples

**Current implementation**
@/YiChing/cvHexagram.xaml.cs
```csharp
            var settings = _mainPage.CVConfig.Settings;
            return $"{DateTime.Now:yyyy-MM-dd}\n{settings.QuestionPrefix}\n {rtQuestion.Text}\n"
                + $"\n{settings.AnswerPrefix}\n{rtAnswer.Text}\n{settings.InterpretationRequest}\n\n{settings.TranslationRequest} {_mainPage.CVConfig.Settings.AnswerLanguage}.";
```

**New output example**
Translate the following I Ching reading into {_mainPage.CVConfig.Settings.AnswerLanguage} and provide an interpretation of the result.

Date: {DateTime.Now:yyyy-MM-dd}
Question to I Ching: {rtQuestion.Text}

I Ching has provided the following hexagrams and lines:

{rtAnswer.Text}

# Steps

1. Translate the hexagrams and question into {_mainPage.CVConfig.Settings.AnswerLanguage}.
2. Provide an interpretation of the main hexagram and how the changing lines influence its meaning.
3. Explain how the changing hexagram provides additional insight or guidance.

# Output Format

Provide a paragraph in {_mainPage.CVConfig.Settings.AnswerLanguage} that includes the translated question, hexagrams, and a detailed interpretation of the I Ching reading.

# Notes

- Pay attention to the meanings of both hexagrams and how the changing lines transition the reading from the main to the changing hexagram.
- Ensure the interpretation reflects the philosophical concepts of the I Ching in the context of the question asked.

# 4

remove the folloving properties from settings.cs and cvConfig:

            keyTwo = "Value Two";
            interpretationRequest = "Would you please interpret?";

# 4.1

@/YiChing/cvHexagram.xaml.cs 

                   $"{settings.StepsHeader}\n\n" +
                   $"1. {settings.Step1}\n" +
                   $"2. {settings.Step2}\n" +
                   $"3. {settings.Step3}\n\n" +
Make StepsHeader and Step1-3 one multiline string and a multiline edit control on cvConfigurations. Concatenate their default values too.

# 4.2
@/YiChing/cvHexagram.xaml.cs 

                   $"{settings.NotesHeader}\n\n" +
                   $"{settings.Note1}\n" +
                   $"{settings.Note2}";
Make NotesHeader andNote1-2 one multiline string and a multiline edit control on cvConfigurations. Concatenate their default values too.

# 5
        public NestedSettings KeyThree { get; set; } should be removed
